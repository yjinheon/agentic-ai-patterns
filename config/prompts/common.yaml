# Common Prompt Templates for Agentic AI Patterns
#
# This file contains shared prompt templates used across multiple patterns.
#
# Design rationale:
# - Jinja2 templating: Use {{ variable }} for variable substitution
# - Reusability: Common prompts shared across patterns
# - Versioning: Easy to track prompt changes in git
# - Experimentation: Modify prompts without changing code
