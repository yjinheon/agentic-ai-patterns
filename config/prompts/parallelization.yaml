# Parallelization Pattern Prompt Templates
#
# Prompt templates specific to the Parallelization pattern.
# Used for parallel execution and result synthesis.
#
# Design rationale:
# - Specialized researchers: Domain-specific instructions
# - Synthesis: Combining parallel results
# - Framework-agnostic: Works with both ADK and LangChain

prompts:
