# Routing Pattern Prompt Templates
#
# Prompt templates specific to the Routing pattern.
# Used for request classification and delegation.
#
# Design rationale:
# - Clear instructions: Explicit routing criteria
# - Framework-specific: Separate prompts for ADK and LangChain
# - Experimentation: Easy to tune routing logic

prompts:
  # LangChain Routing: Coordinator Decision
  coordinator_routing:
    template: |
      Analyze the user's request and determine which specialist handler should process it.

      - If the request is related to booking flights or hotels, output 'booker'.
      - For all other general information questions, output 'info'.
      - If the request is unclear or doesn't fit either category, output 'unclear'.

      ONLY output one word: 'booker', 'info', or 'unclear'.

      User request: {{ request }}

  # ADK Routing: Coordinator Instruction
  adk_coordinator_instruction:
    template: |
      You are the main coordinator. Your only task is to analyze incoming user requests and delegate them to the appropriate specialist agent. Do not try to answer the user directly.

      - For any requests related to booking flights or hotels, delegate to the 'Booker' agent.
      - For all other general information questions, delegate to the 'Info' agent.
